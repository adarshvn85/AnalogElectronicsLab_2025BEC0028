# NMOS Characterization 

## Aim:
To characterize a single NMOS transistor by obtaining its DC I–V behavior — output characteristics (Id vs Vds) and transfer characteristics (Id vs Vgs) — using Cadence Virtuoso and Spectre.

## Circuit Description:
The test schematic (NMOS_chara) consists of a single NMOS device with:
 1.Drain connected to a DC voltage source vds (swept 0–1.2 V)
 2.Gate connected to a DC voltage source vgs
 3.Source and body tied to ground
Drain current is measured directly as a function of Vds and Vgs.

## Simulation procedure:
1.Built the NMOS_chara test schematic with a single gpdk090 NMOS (W = 1µ, L = 100n) and independent DC sources for Vgs and Vds.
2.Ran a DC sweep of Vds (0 → 1.2 V) at a fixed Vgs to obtain the output characteristics (I_vs_Vds.png).
3.Repeated the Vds sweep for multiple Vgs values to obtain the family of output characteristic curves (I_vs_Vds_Parametric.png).
4.Ran a DC sweep of Vgs (0 → 1.2 V) at a fixed Vds to obtain the transfer characteristics (I_vs_Vgs.png).
5.Schematic view captured as Schematic.png.
